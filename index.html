    <h1>The Circuit</h1>
    <div class="subheading">A dream of philosophy, survival, and silent truths.</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Some dreams feel random. This one didn’t. This felt like my brain was trying to tell me everything—about the world, about people, about how we break and survive.</p>
      <p>This dream... was philosophy, physics, irony and something deeper than all of them combined.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It began on a normal evening. I was exhausted—mentally, physically. Walking home, my little brother by my side. He’s got this light in him—like the world hasn’t touched him yet. He noticed I was down and said something simple: <span class="quote">“Let’s race home.”</span></p>
      <p>So we ran. Laughing like kids. Our mother walking behind us, a quiet warmth in her eyes.</p>
      <p>And then, mid-laugh—the sky turned dark. Not “it might rain” dark—unnatural, heavy, choking. And then… it happened.</p>
      <p>The electrical wires. Every single one. Came crashing down. They didn’t snap. They fell—as if cut by something bigger than gravity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>And in that same breath, people started vanishing. Not all people. Just… certain ones. The ones who were bitter, angry, stressed, fake—gone. Like the system just... deleted them.</p>
      <p>The wires weren’t just metal and current. They were a metaphor. A truth. People live lives like those wires—straight, parallel, untouching. They follow tracks set by others, never crossing, never breaking free.</p>
      <p>But the ones who survived? They weren’t looking up. They were grounded. Present. Alive in the moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Then came the rain. It started slow. Gentle. But with every drop, a danger crept in. We realized something horrifying: Anyone who touched the rain vanished.</p>
      <p>Electricity flows. Rainwater conducts. And now, with the wires down, the circuit was complete. The rain became the final piece. Touch it, and you connected back to that system—the invisible force that had already taken the stressed and conformed.</p>
      <p><span class="quote">Electricity + rainwater = system reboot.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>My father didn’t make it. A lot of people didn’t. The world fell into a hushed, eerie state. No signal. No news. No leaders. Just silence, wet asphalt, and dread.</p>
      <p>Then—one spark of hope. My grandpa. He made the journey to our home, on foot. His presence lit something in me I hadn’t felt in days: courage.</p>
      <p>Later, my mother revealed the truth: <span class="quote">“A drop… just one tiny dew drop. It fell on your grandpa... on his way back.”</span></p>
      <p>He hadn’t made it. She kissed my forehead. And stepped into the rain. Gone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Now it was just me. And my little brother. We stayed for each other. In a makeshift camp. The sky never turned blue again. Just grey. Endless.</p>
      <p>Until—one morning. A golden light. The clouds parted. And from the mist… my father. Behind him—everyone. They had found peace where we found only pain.</p>
      <p>Then came a man. Tall. Robed. Voice deep and commanding: <span class="quote">“To those who remained… you have each won ₹1 crore.”</span></p>
      <p>There was silence. A few smiles. But something deeper sat beneath it all. A strange awareness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="final">
      That even survival... even pain… is expected to end in a prize.<br />
      That we live in a world where peace must come with payment.<br />
      Where meaning must be rewarded, or it isn’t seen as real.<br />
      And so we stood there. Holding hands. Smiling… but not quite.
