    <h1>The Eighth Floor</h1>
    <div class="subheading">Some dreams don’t scream. They whisper.</div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You ever wake up from a dream that feels… more like a warning than a dream? Like your mind wasn’t just imagining things—but showing you something?</p>
      <p>Some places don't scream danger. <span class="quote">They whisper it. Soft enough that only your bones hear it first.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>It started as a getaway. Me, a few friends, the open road. We found it deep in the woods: a hotel—tall, pristine, wrapped in vines and gold light. <span class="highlight">Seven floors</span>, the clerk said.</p>
      <p>When I saw the building, something in my stomach turned. Not fear. Something worse. Knowing.</p>
      <p>But I ignored it. We checked in. Laughed. Took pictures. Believed what we wanted to believe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Later, I returned to the lobby to get my luggage. Pressed the elevator button. Saw something strange. Seven floor buttons… and one more: <span class="highlight">G for Ground</span>.</p>
      <p>No one mentioned a ground floor. Curiosity won. I pressed it.</p>
      <p>The doors opened with a soft hiss. And everything changed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The hallway was yellow. Sickly. The air smelled metallic. And then I saw them—children in giant test tubes. Floating. Silent. Not dead, not alive. Doll-like.</p>
      <p>These weren’t ordinary children. These were the <span class="highlight">different</span>. The ones society tried to erase—Autism. ADHD. Beautiful minds deemed <i>wrong</i>.</p>
      <p>And they were all brown. Black. But their skin... pale. Blond. False.</p>
      <p><span class="quote">Cracked porcelain over living faces.</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The realization hit: this place wasn’t luxury. It was <span class="highlight">erasure</span>. A system disguised as care. A machine for making people disappear beneath politeness, beneath kindness, beneath lies.</p>
      <p>Seven floors for comfort. An eighth for cruelty.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="separator"></div>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I stood frozen. Not because I didn’t understand—but because I did. This wasn’t just a dream. This was a truth. One the world hides under soft lighting and floral wallpapers.</p>
      <p>I stepped back into the elevator. The door slid shut like a secret being kept.</p>
      <p>When I returned upstairs, nothing had changed. My friends still laughed. The stars still blinked. The hotel still glowed. But now I knew.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <p><span class="quote">There are hotels like this everywhere.</p>
      <p>Places built on the silence of the different. Places that conform, correct, erase.</p>
      <p>They don’t look like evil. Because they never have to.</span></p>
    </div>
